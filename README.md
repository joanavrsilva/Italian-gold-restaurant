    -  I can easily navigate through the site so that I can understand its purpose;
    -  I have access to the menu and so that I know what food the restaurant offer;
    -  I can see a location tab in the website so that I can know here the restaurant is located;
    -  I can see a little description about the restaurant so that I can know more about the restaurant history;
    -  I can see how I can contact the restaurant so that I can communicate with the restaurant easily;
    -  I can choose a date and time for a booking so that I can quickly book a table;
    -  I can choose how many people I want in my reservation so that I can have a table suitable for the number of people;
    -  I can leave special requirements on my reservation so I can communicate them to the restaurant;
    -  I can receive an email with my booking details so that I can have a confirmation of my booking;
    -  I can register an account so that I can easily access my reservations;

- As a(n) admin/restaurant owner/employee:

    - I can see how many tables have been reserved so I can know how many people will be in the restaurant;
    - I can see what special requirements my customers added when they booked the table so that I can respond to those requests;
    - Through my account, I can view, modify or cancel reservations so that I can manage the reservations for each day;
    - I can see when a customer has made a reservation or modified their reservation so that I can manage the restaurant booked tables more efficiently.
